ðŸ§  Project Overview: RSS Feed Summarizer AI

This project is an intelligent RSS feed reader that leverages OpenAI's API to automate content discovery, filtering, summarization, and distribution across productivity tools. It's designed to help knowledge workers (like engineers, product teams, and execs) stay on top of relevant insightsâ€”without being overwhelmed by noise.
ðŸ“Œ End-to-End System Flow

1. Fetch Articles from RSS Feeds
Pull articles from a user-defined list of RSS feed URLs.
Only retrieve articles published in the last 24 hours or past 7 days, based on user preference.
Use the feedparser library to parse article metadata: title, link, published date, summary, and optionally full content.
2. Filter Articles for Relevance
Each article is analyzed to determine:
"Is this article relevant to the topic or themes we're tracking (e.g. AI tools, ML research, startup innovation)?"
Only relevant articles are passed to the next step. Irrelevant articles are discarded.
3. Categorize Relevant Articles
Based on article content, apply topical tags or categories like:
ðŸ“š Research
ðŸ§  AI Tools
ðŸ“ˆ Industry News
ðŸ’¡ Product Ideas
This helps in organizing and routing articles later (e.g. AI â†’ Notion; Business â†’ Slack).
4. Summarize Articles
Relevant articles are sent to a summarizer agent that:
Generates a two-sentence summary with key insights.
Appends the original article link for full reading.
Optionally adds metadata like source name and publish date.
5. Distribute Summaries to Target Channels
Users can connect any combination of:
ðŸ”” Slack â€” daily/weekly digest sent to a team channel.
ðŸ“§ Email â€” personalized summary report.
ðŸ§  Notion â€” updates a table or database with article summaries and tags.
Summaries are automatically routed based on category.
6. Star or Highlight High-Impact Articles
Option to mark articles as "ðŸŒŸ insightful" using:
Slack emoji reaction
Notion property toggle
Email reply with keyword
Starred articles can trigger special workflows like:
Saving to a "Big Ideas" section
Sending to a founder, CTO, or PM
Archiving in a dedicated Notion page for strategy reviews
ðŸŽ¯ Project Goals

Save time by automating news discovery.
Keep teams informed on developments in their focus areas.
Create a lightweight tool you and your coworkers will actually use.
